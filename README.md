# Supervised-learning-project
Group work
This repository contains two supervised learning methods to analyse the Sloan Digital Survey
dataset. This dataset contains five variables of different colour indices and the dependent
variables are quasar, giant star and white dwarfs. The analyses are performed using the R
programming language. We employ two supervised learning algorithms for the analyses which
are the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the Classification Tree. The methods are
implemented for prediction, based on data analysis and understanding the dataset provided.
The accuracy of each method is measured, and a comparison between two models is
provided. According to the findings, the Classification Tree performed better at predicting this
datasetâ€™s dependent variable than the Discriminant Analysis.
